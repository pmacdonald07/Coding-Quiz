# Coding-Quiz

The goal of this project was to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a coding quiz that would save high scores in local storage.

To complete this task I did the following:
    Create a starting screen that would display the rules and hide once the start quiz button was clicked.
    Create a series of questions and answers as an array that would cycle until there were no more questions.
    Tracked which answer was chosen based on data attributes.
    Dynamically created HTML elements including a form, input field, and button for users to submit their initials.
    Saved high scores to local storage upon submitting the form.
    Loaded high scores from local storage.
    Utilized a second HTML page for high scores.

By completing this project I gained a great deal more experience combining HTML, CSS, and JS. I had to create the project from scratch, which was a challenge. I had to plan and execute each step, from wireframing the HTML to utilizing localStorage with JS. This was excellent practice, and while I know my code is not perfect, I am satisfied with what I've learned and accomplished.
